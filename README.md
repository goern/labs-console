```


### Getting Started

**Step 1**. Clone this repository:

```shell
$ git clone -o upstream -b master --single-branch \
      https://github.com/rht-labs/labs-console.git labs-console
$ cd labs-console
$ npm install                   # Install project dependencies listed in package.json
```

**Step 2**. Compile and launch:

```shell
$ node run                      # Same as `npm start` or `node run start`
```

You can also test your app in release (production) mode by running `node run start --release` or
with HMR and React Hot Loader disabled by running `node run start --no-hmr`. The app should become
available at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).


### How to Test

The unit tests are powered by [chai](http://chaijs.com/) and [mocha](http://mochajs.org/).

```shell
$ npm run lint                  # Check JavaScript and CSS code for potential issues
$ npm run test                  # Run unit tests. Or, `npm run test:watch`
```

### How to Deploy

To build for production, run:

```shell
$ node run build                # Or, `node run build --release` for production build
```
You can then safely deploy /public in your application.
